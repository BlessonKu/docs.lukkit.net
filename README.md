# Lukkit Documentation
Documentation for Lukkit v1.1.3 and below.

Please note that this site is no longer useful, as it was nearly just a re-designed copy of the Spigot API documentation, but used specifically for Lukkit. Please visit the [Lukkit repository](https://github.com/artex-development/Lukkit) for more information on Lukkit. Documentation of the Spigot API can be found [here](https://hub.spigotmc.org/javadocs/spigot/).
