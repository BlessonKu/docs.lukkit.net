# Storage

Storage allows you to create configuration and storage files for your plugin. Creating a file is as easy as calling the [plugin.getStorageObject(file: string)](Globals#plugingetstorageobjectfile-string) method. The file parameter is relative to the plugin data folder and supports the file types `YAML` and `JSON`.
